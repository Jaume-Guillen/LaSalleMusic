# LaSalleMusic
A music reproducer made with Java and SQL that lets you listen to music and add songs to playlists.

The zip has two different programs: the Server and the Client. The server must be executed in the same PC you plan to use the Client (or Clients), and lets you upload music to the database. The Client lets you create playlists, listen to the music on the server and rate it.

There's also a Javadoc that contains all the functions of the program to make the code more comprehensible. Also, the Server folder contains a database file to initialise the SQL database.
